# Simple Guide to Install and Use This AI

Hello bro 👋, if you downloaded this folder, it means you want to use this AI.
Before installing, here are a few things you should know:

### Important Notes

* This is **not a full AI**.
* It cannot code, write essays, or improve itself.
* It only works because of other libraries, and the **speech-to-text part** is made by me (using Chrome).
* You can chat with it and ask questions in real-time.
* Speak in **English** for best accuracy.
* And no, this won’t run on a potato PC 😅 — you need a decent computer.

## Step 1: Install Python

You need **Python 3.10.11**.
Download it from here:
👉 [Python 3.10.11 Download](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11-embed-amd64.zip)

---

## Step 2: VS Code Setup

* Open any Python file in **VS Code**.
* At the bottom bar, select the Python environment (`{}`Python).
* Check the **Tutorial folder** in this project – it has images to guide you in creating the environment.

## Step 3: Install Required Libraries

All libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.
Install them one by one in the terminal using:

```bash
pip install <library-name>
```

After installing, check if the library is correctly recognized in VS Code (the import text should appear colored).

## Step 4: Change File Path in SpeechToText

Open the **SpeechToText.py** file.
Go to **line 60** and change the file path:

```python
Link = "file:///d:/Lunar/Data/Voice.html"
```

Change `d:/A-ver1/` to your folder location.

* Example: If your folder is in `C:`, then use:

  ```
  C:/Lunar/Data/Voice.html
  ```
* If you put it in another folder, add that folder name too:

  ```
  D:/MyFolder/Lunar/Data/Voice.html
  ```

## Step 5: Get API Keys

You need two API keys:

1. **Cohere API** (Free)
   👉 [Get Cohere API](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/rate-limits)

2. **Groq API** (not “Grok”)
   👉 [Get Groq API](https://console.groq.com/keys)

---

## Step 6: Add API Keys to `.env` File

In the `.env` file, paste your keys like this:

```
COHERE_API_KEY = your_cohere_api
Username = YourName
AssistantName = Lunar   # You can change this name if you want
GroqAPIKey = your_groq_api
AssistantVoice = en-CA-LiamNeural
InputLanguage = en
```

## Features

* Can **open/close apps** (Instagram, Facebook, any installed software).
* Can **search real-time data**.
* Can **play YouTube songs** (say “Play \[song name]”).
* Works best if you **speak slow, clear, and close to the mic**.
* If it breaks, just restart the file.

✅ That’s it! You’re ready to use your AI Assistant.
